    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Pascal, and I enjoy learning new technologies and improving my skills in programming and design. I like working on small projects that help me understand concepts better.</p>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>

    <p>I am currently exploring web development and enjoy building simple pages as I learn. I also spend time experimenting with tools like Python, Android development, and Git.</p>

    <h3>My Goals</h3>

    <p>I want to become a strong developer who can build useful applications. Every day I learn something new, and I try to apply it through practical tasks and projects.</p>

    <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy discovering new ideas, solving problems, and finding creative ways to express what I learn.</p>
